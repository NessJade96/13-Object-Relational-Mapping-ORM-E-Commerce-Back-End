## Commit notes:

1. Copied the starter code and set up the readme.

2. Went through all the files to read and understand what I have to do. Input the values (sequelize) into the models files. Set up and seeded the server - checking this on MySQL workbench.

3. Went through and populated the code into the api files, most of this code is just copy and paste - I have not updated them to work inside each api file.

4. Got the Categories api route working, insomnia requests are functioning (get, post, put, delete).

5. The products api route working, insomnia requests are functioning (get, post, put, delete).
